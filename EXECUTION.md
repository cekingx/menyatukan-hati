# EXECUTION.md - Wedding Invitation Implementation Plan

## Overview
The wedding invitation website is approximately 90% complete based on the PRD requirements. All core sections are implemented (hero, couple intro, vedic prayer, wedding details, footer) but missing the photo gallery component and proper asset management.

## Current Status
✅ **Implemented:**
- Hero section with couple names and "Open Invitation" CTA
- Couple introduction with family details and Om Swastiastu greeting
- Vedic prayer section
- Wedding details with date, time, venue, and countdown
- Footer with "Matur Suksma" and attribution
- Modern Angular 20 standalone components architecture
- TailwindCSS v4 styling
- Responsive design

❌ **Missing:**
- Photo gallery section (mentioned in PRD Section 5)
- Proper git tracking of assets folder

## Phased Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Asset Management & Repository Cleanup
**Estimated Token Usage: ~3,000 tokens**

**Objectives:**
- Add untracked `public/assets/` folder to git repository
- Verify all image paths are accessible and properly configured
- Clean up any unused assets
- Test current website functionality

**Tasks:**
1. Check git status and add untracked assets
2. Verify image accessibility in existing components
3. Commit asset management changes
4. Run development server to test current functionality
5. Document any issues found

**Success Criteria:**
- All assets properly tracked in git
- No broken image links
- Website loads without console errors

- Create PhotoGallery standalone component following project patterns
- Implement responsive grid layout for wedding photos
- Add lightbox/modal functionality for full-size image viewing
- Style component with TailwindCSS to match existing rose wedding theme

**Tasks:**
1. Generate PhotoGallery component structure:
   - `src/app/components/photo-gallery/photo-gallery.ts`
   - `src/app/components/photo-gallery/photo-gallery.html`
   - `src/app/components/photo-gallery/photo-gallery.css`
2. Implement TypeScript component logic
3. Create responsive HTML template with grid layout
4. Add CSS styling with TailwindCSS classes
5. Implement lightbox modal functionality
6. Add smooth transitions and hover effects

**Success Criteria:**
- Component builds without TypeScript errors
- Responsive grid displays properly on all screen sizes
- Lightbox opens and closes smoothly
- Styling matches existing wedding theme

### Phase 3: Gallery Integration & Content
**Estimated Token Usage: ~6,000 tokens**

**Objectives:**
- Integrate PhotoGallery component into main application
- Configure gallery with wedding photos
- Ensure proper section ordering per PRD
- Optimize image loading and performance

**Tasks:**
1. Import PhotoGallery component in main app
2. Add photo gallery section to app template (between wedding details and footer)
3. Configure gallery images and metadata
4. Test integration with existing sections
5. Verify scroll behavior and section transitions
6. Optimize image loading (lazy loading if needed)

**Success Criteria:**
- Photo gallery displays in correct order per PRD
- Smooth transitions between all sections
- Gallery integrates seamlessly with existing design
- Good performance on mobile devices

---

### Phase 4: Final Testing & Polish
**Estimated Token Usage: ~5,000 tokens**

**Objectives:**
- Comprehensive testing across all website sections
- Verify all interactive elements work correctly
- Ensure responsive design excellence
- Run code quality checks

**Tasks:**
1. Test countdown timer functionality
2. Verify "Open Invitation" scroll behavior
3. Test photo gallery lightbox on all devices
4. Check responsive design on mobile, tablet, desktop
5. Run `ng test` for any unit tests
6. Run `ng build` to verify production build
7. Test cross-browser compatibility
8. Verify all environment variables and configurations

**Success Criteria:**
- All interactive elements function correctly
- Website is fully responsive (mobile score >95% per PRD)
- No console errors or TypeScript issues
- Production build succeeds
- Page load time <3 seconds (per PRD success metrics)

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment Preparation
**Estimated Token Usage: ~3,000 tokens**

**Objectives:**
- Update project documentation
- Prepare for deployment
- Final code cleanup and optimization
- Commit final changes

**Tasks:**
1. Update component documentation
2. Verify all TODOs and FIXMEs resolved
3. Run final linting and formatting
4. Test final production build

## Token Management Strategy
- Each phase designed to stay under 8K tokens
- Focus on single responsibility per phase
- Minimal cross-phase dependencies
- Clear success criteria for each phase completion

## Next Steps
Execute phases sequentially, ensuring each phase's success criteria are met before proceeding to the next phase.
